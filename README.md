# Floating Point analysis applied to Machine Learning predictors

This project started as a class project for the Machine Learning class offered at the University of Utah. 
The goal of the analysis is to study what is the impact of floating point precision on the accuracy of well known machine learning predictors: Perceptron (and Average) and SVM. 
The analysis is built upon numerical libraries: [MPFR](http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html) and [SoftFloat](https://iis-git.ee.ethz.ch/pulp-sw/softFloat).

## Getting Started

Follow this instruction to get a copy of the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* Python: tested with Python 2.7.12;
* [gcc Compiler]() Tested with gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.5);
* [MPFR](http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html#Installing-MPFR) - MPFR library;
* [SoftFloat](https://iis-git.ee.ethz.ch/pulp-sw/softFloat) - SoftFloat library (In particular FlexFloat);


### Installing
After all libraies have been installed in the machine, the only file you need to modify is ```src/execute.py```.
In particular:
* ```pathDatasets="(insert datasets paths)"``` ex: pathDatasets="/home/user/project/datasets/";
* ```mpfrcpp="(path to the project file /src/MPFR-ML/src/mpfrcpp.cpp")``` ex. mpfrcpp="../src/mpfr.cpp"
* ```softfloat="(path to SoftFloat library)"``` ex. "/home/user/softFloat/"
* ```flexfloatcpp=(path to the project file /src/FlexFloat-ML/flexfloat.cpp")```

## Running the tests

### Datasets
The path ```pathDatasets``` has to contain a folder for each dataset we want to analyse.
In particular the dataset has to be splitted in four parts with names: ```part1.txt; part2.txt; part3.txt; part4.txt```

The directory tree has to look like the following:
```
pathDatasets/myDataset/part1.txt
pathDatasets/myDataset/part2.txt
pathDatasets/myDataset/part3.txt
pathDatasets/myDataset/part4.txt
```
The dataset has to be in the following format:

```value value value 1 label```

Inside the folder tools exists a file ```preprocessor.py``` that performs the following format conversion.

From the LIBSVM format (it can contains missing attributes):
```
label 1:value 2:value 3:value ... n:value
label 1:value 2:value 3:value ... n:value
label 1:value 2:value 3:value ... n:value
label 1:value 2:value 3:value ... n:value
```

To the representation in use.
